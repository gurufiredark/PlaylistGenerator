# Playlist Generator

**About:** Based on a pre-selection of songs, it generates playlists based on the similarities between the songs. This code concerns the Classification and Partitioning Problem, which is solved using the genetic algorithms technique.

**Selected Attributes:** The similarities and characteristics that will be compared are: danceability, energy and valence.

1. _danceability:_ describes the ability of the music to have a dance beat. The higher the value, the more danceable the music is.

2. _energy:_ represents the perceived energy in the music. Energetic tracks are fast, loud, and high-pitched. Calm and smooth tracks have lower energy values.

3. _valence:_ represents the positivity or negativity of the music. Positive tracks have values close to 1.0, while negative tracks have values close to 0.0.
